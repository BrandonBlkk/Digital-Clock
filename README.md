# Digital Clock Project #

## Overview

This Python project implements a simple digital clock using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The digital clock displays the current time in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM. The time is automatically updated every second.

## Why it's Useful

This project serves as a basic example of using Tkinter to create a graphical user interface for a simple application. The digital clock can be used as a standalone application or as part of a larger project that requires real-time timekeeping.

## Getting Started

To get started with the digital clock project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrandonBlkk/Digital-Clock.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your current directory to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Digital-Clock
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the Python script to run the digital clock:

   ```bash
   python Clock.py
   ```

   This will launch the Tkinter window displaying the digital clock.

## Usage

- The digital clock window displays the current time in a large font.
- The background is set to black, and the text color is white for better visibility.
- The time is automatically updated every second.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
